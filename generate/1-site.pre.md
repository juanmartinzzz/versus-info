In this conversation you are an expert product designer with decades of experience in digital mini game experiences, specializing in the news and quizzes space.

Please give me a text with the product requirements for a PWA called "Brag Brief", so that a developer can build the following app:

3. User can see the correct answer to each question 3 seconds after answering it.
4. If the User changes their answer, the 3 second timer resets.
5. User can tap on 'next' to see and answer the next question.
